            <h3>2. Survey Administration</h3>
            <h4>Methodology</h2>
            <p>
                The survey was distributed through email, social media, and student groups to a mix of students and parents. The aim was to collect feedback from users who can simulate the platform’s real target audience of healthcare professionals and parents due to time constraints in accessing the actual audience.
            </p>
            <p>The survey link was shared across multiple channels to ensure diversity in responses, and group members were excluded from participation. The target sample size for analysis was set at 30 respondents.</p>
        
            <h4>Findings</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Total respondents: 30.</li>
                <li>Respondent demographics: 60% were students, and 40% were parents.</li>
                <li>Familiarity with diagnostic tools: 72% of respondents had prior exposure to similar tools.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>3. Data Collection and Statistical Analysis</h1>
            <h4>Methodology</h2>
            <p>
                Once the survey is distributed, responses are collected automatically via Google Forms. The data is exported for analysis. The following statistical methods were used:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mean and Standard Deviation:</strong> To determine the central tendency and variability of user feedback.</li>
                <li><strong>Frequency Distribution:</strong> To understand the distribution of responses across the Likert scale for each question.</li>
                <li><strong>Correlation Analysis:</strong> To explore relationships between key variables such as ease of use and overall satisfaction.</li>
                <li><strong>Chi-Square Test:</strong> Used to identify statistically significant differences between student and parent responses.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h4>Findings</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Average ease of use rating: 1.5 (SD: 0.4).</li>
                <li>Visual aids helpfulness: 80% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed.</li>
                <li>Correlation coefficient: 0.82 between ease of navigation and overall satisfaction, indicating a strong positive relationship.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>4. Charts and Presentation of Results </h1>
            <h4>Methodology</h2>
            <p>The survey results were visualized using:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bar Graphs: To display response distributions for each question.</li>
                <li>Pie Charts: To summarize overall satisfaction ratings.</li>
                <li>Line Graphs: To show trends in ease of use and satisfaction.</li>
            </ul>
            

            <p>
                The results are integrated into a new Design Evaluation tab on the BrainWave Diagnostics website, charts and a google doc report summarizing key findings.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Recorded Presentation</h1>
    <h4>Methodology</h2>
    <p>A recorded presentation was created to demonstrate the prototype and discuss the design evaluation. The 15-minute presentation includes the following sections:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Prototype Demo:</strong> A walkthrough showing the login screen, scan upload process, report generation, and user interactions.</li>
        <li><strong>Website Overview:</strong> A demonstration of how the prototype, help section, and evaluation results are integrated into the BrainWave Diagnostics website.</li>
        <li><strong>Design Evaluation Results:</strong> A summary of key findings from the survey analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Future Enhancements:</strong> A discussion of planned improvements based on user feedback.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The recorded presentation is uploaded to the website design evaluation page as a YouTube link for easy access.</p>
